# Urban Traffic Management System

This project is designed as a comprehensive software solution to predict and manage urban road traffic, significantly improving the flow of vehicles and minimizing congestion. 

## Key Features

### 1. **Traffic Visualization**
- **Interactive Charts and Graphs**: 
  - Visualize historical traffic data for chosen time-frames.
  - Explore traffic trends and make data-driven decisions.
- **Dynamic Traffic Heatmap**:
  - Integrated with Google Maps for real-time congestion visualization.
  - Color-coded zones indicate high, moderate, and low traffic density.

### 2. **Traffic Prediction**
- **Machine Learning Integration**:
  - Trained on historical data to predict future traffic congestion patterns.
  - Provides critical insights into potential bottlenecks, aiding in early prevention and planning.

### 3. **Smart Traffic Signal Management**
- **Simulated Signal Control**:
  - Automatically adjusts traffic signal timings based on predicted traffic volumes.
  - Optimizes traffic flow across road junctions, alleviating congestion.

## Objectives
- **Improve Traffic Flow**: Enhance vehicle movement in urban areas.
- **Minimize Congestion**: Identify and address traffic blockages before they occur.
- **Sustainability and Innovation**: Contribute to the development of smarter, greener cities.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **Google Maps API**: For creating the dynamic traffic heatmap.
- **Machine Learning**: For training predictive traffic models.
- **Data Visualization Libraries**: To generate charts and graphs.
